Has increased allocation in sanitation come at the cost of decreased allocations for water? The NRDWP has shown a gradual decline since 2012-13 till 2016-17. (Table 7.1). The issue of water quality and sustainability persists in rural water.  With many states in the country reeling under a drought crisis, the allocation for rural water could have seen higher allocations."

Evidences show that toilets are being constructed usually in areas which already have existing water supply connections. This leaves out a large section of the population who live in unauthorized colonies. Toilet construction amounts to a large part of the expenditures accounted in SBM. This should also simultaneously lead to increased usage and behavior change. Sustainability of toilets and slip-back in sanitation behavior needs to be looked into."
